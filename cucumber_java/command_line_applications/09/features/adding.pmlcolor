  Scenario: Add two numbers       # features/adding.feature:3
    Given the input "2+2"         # features/step_definitions/calculator_steps.rb:1
    When the calculator is run    # features/step_definitions/calculator_steps.rb:19
    Then the output should be "4" # features/step_definitions/calculator_steps.rb:25

  Scenario: Add two numbers interactively    # features/adding.feature:9
    When the calculator is run with no input # features/step_definitions/calculator_steps.rb:11
      TODO (Cucumber::Pending)
      ./features/step_definitions/calculator_steps.rb:12
      features/adding.feature:10
    And I enter the calculation "2+2"        # features/step_definitions/calculator_steps.rb:14
    Then the output should be "4"            # features/step_definitions/calculator_steps.rb:25
