You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^the User has posted the message "([^"]*)"$/) do |arg1|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

When(/^I visit the page for the User$/) do
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end

Then(/^I should see "([^"]*)"$/) do |arg1|
  pending # Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
end
